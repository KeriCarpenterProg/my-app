# My app website

This website is a playground for Keri Carpenter to test out all sorts of programming knowledge that she is trying out.

This website will just remain a playground to test things out while it is being used.  At some point, I'm sure I will be moving on, but in Summer 2021 it is pretty current.

This is my 3rd commit on this pull request.

Hi Keri! I think I am getting the hang of this.
Just adding some text here to see if it worked, crossing my fingers! 

Updated 5/28/21 Keri Carpenter (on Timothy Reid's forked repository of my app)

Adding one more line on 6/6/21 just to see how it works with my branch.

Hi Tim!  these are some changes that I am submitting on 6/6/21 from Keri to see how this works!

Just so you know, somehow your changes above got submitted on my repo too, so I'm thinking that even once you clone it there is some connection.  I'm sort of testing that now.

Keri is making a change on 6/20/21.  My hypothesis is that it will make a PR on Tim Reid's version of "my" repo.  I further hypothesize that it will be committed on my repo as a patch, probably patch-3, automatically.  Let's see what happens.

6/26/21 Keri is adding one more line in here!

6/26/21 Keri is adding a second line in here on her own repo!

7/17/21 Just updating one line so patch-3 is ahead of my local branch.

7/17/21 I'm adding one line on the local branch
