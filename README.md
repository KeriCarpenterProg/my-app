# My app website

This website is a playground for Keri Carpenter to test out all sorts of programming knowledge that she is trying out.

This website will just remain a playground to test things out while it is being used.  At some point, I'm sure I will be moving on, but in Summer 2021 it is pretty current.

This is my 3rd commit on this pull request.

Hi Keri! I think I am getting the hang of this.
Just adding some text here to see if it worked, crossing my fingers! 


Updated 5/28/21 Keri Carpenter (on Timothy Reid's forked repository of my app)

Adding one more line on 6/6/21 just to see how it works with my branch.
