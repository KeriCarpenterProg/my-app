    <h1>
      This is Keri's Page that takes input and changes text via javascript.
    </h1>
    <p>This is an example page that I grabbed from a site by David Flanagan</p>
    <p>This page is a little more involved in that it carries an entire loan calculating process on it.  It will take me days and days to do this.  Not sure I want to do it.</p>
    <p>
      My intention here is to work with and get better at modifying text on the
      page with javascript.
