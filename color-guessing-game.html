    <h1>Color Guessing Game</h1>
    <p>This is a practice application for a class that I am taking.</p>
    <p>
      I will generate a random color from a pre-defined array of colors and you
      will guess which one got selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be different types of output based on whether it matches or
      not.
    </p>
    <p>The interaction is all within an alert box.</p>
    <button type="button" onClick="runGame()">Start Game</button>
